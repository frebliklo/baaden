Apparently, there are different sorts of plywood, and the kind needed for a boat  is 6 mm marine plywood, eg. Okoume or in my case, Okoumflex which has a waterproof layers

This sort of plywwod is not a common good among my nearest wood distributors, however I wanted the plywwod boards as soon as possible, and found boards in the size of 2500 x 1220 mm in Krydsfinérhandlen in Rødovre. I bought 4 boards to be sure that I had a sufficient amount of wood if any laser cutting would go wrong (which it usually does), and they fit perfectly on top of a station car. I went to XL-byg (also in Rødovre), to get the boards cut into the sizes of  1200x800 mm which fits the laser cutter (see next post)
